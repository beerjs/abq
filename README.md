## Slack

Sure. BeerJS has a Slack channel and there is a channel for #albuquerque. [Join](https://beerjs-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) it here if you don't have enough Slack channels in your life.

Oh and since we are talking about Slack, you can join the ABQWebgeeks Slack channel by filling out a simple form on our [website](http://www.abqwebgeeks.org).

## Why GitHub?

* If you're doing cool stuff with JS, you're probably on GitHub anyway
* GitHub is free, Meetup costs money
* Why not?
