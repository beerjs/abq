# ABQ Beer.js

BeerJS Abq is a monthly meetup for beer liking folks around The Duke City doing cool things with JavaScript. By default, we meet the last Wednesday of the month, typically
at 6:30pm. Sometimes people post a special request (e.g., a date change to accommodate a visitor from out of town) as an issue.
